# Upper Confidence Bound(UCB)

In this dataset we're going to optimize the online advertising meaning that we're going to find the best
ad among different ads designs. The best ad that will convert the maximum customers to click on the ad and you know potentially buy the product by the car.
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:29,580
So what happened exactly is that the advertising team has prepared 10 different ads with 10 different designs.
So basically all the ads have different designs and advertising team is wondering well which ad will
convert the most customers, which ad will attract the most people to click the ad and then potentially buy the product.
we're going to show these ads to different users online.
once they connect to a certain Web site or to a search engine you know it can be ads that appear
at the top of a page when you type of research on Google.
We're going to show one of these ads each time the user connects to the Web page and we're going to record the result whether this user clicked yes or no on the ad.
